1,Damian,"""I know, I know. My grades are slipping, and my advisor’s worried about my scholarships, but he won’t get what’s going on. His background is not like mine…I just feel like when I go out, everyone is looking at me. I don’t fit in. """,
1,bad1,"""Well, your scholarships are pretty important, and you might lose them, so I can see why your advisor is worried.""","""It sounds like you’re concerned about Damian’s success. This response <span class=""bold""> centers Damian’s advisor over Damian’s concerns </span>. Try a response that offers a reflection or restatement."""
1,good,"""That can feel lonely. You said your advisor’s background is different and that you feel like you don’t fit in. Could we talk more about that?""","""Good choice. You’re <span class=""bold"">echoing</span> Damian’s sense of isolation and are curious about the factors related to not fitting in. This response <span class=""bold"">reflects</span> and <span class=""bold"">explores client identity</span> and will likely help Damian feel heard and safe."""
1,bad2,"""Sounds stressful. Your advisor sounds worried, but I want to hear about you. How do you feel about your grades?""","""Here you’ve <span class=""bold"">directed</span> Damian to share his feelings about his grades. This may not be Damian’s primary concern. Try a different response that offers a reflection or restatement about what he may be concerned about."""
2,Damian,"""Yeah, I’m not sure if it would make sense to you, though, fitting in, I mean.""",
2,good,"""Thanks for being honest with me. I’m hearing you think I would not understand your concerns. I want to recognize how our differences may impact our work together.""","""Good response! Here you’re demonstrating that you’ve heard Damian’s concerns and are willing to <span class=""bold"">acknowledge</span> how your <span class=""bold"">potential differences may impact therapy</span>.  By saying this, you’ve shown you are not defensive about what Damian is bringing up. Let’s see what Damian says next."""
2,bad1,"""I think it could make sense. I went here for my undergrad not too long ago. I bet, on some level, I could understand about not “fitting in.”""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">self-disclose</span> about a shared experience with Damian. While potentially helpful, the response <span class=""bold"">may dismiss Damian's experience</span>. Try a response that affirms you are listening to Damian."""
2,bad2,"""A lot of people feel what you are experiencing in college. If it helps, it’s normative to feel out of place in your first year in college.""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">normalize</span> Damian’s experience. While helpful in some instances, this response <span class=""bold"">may invalidate Damian’s unique experience of isolation</span>. Try a response that affirms you are listening to Damian."""
3,Damian,"""I just <span class=""bold"">feel</span> like you can’t understand. Honestly, it might just be me.""",
3,good,"""This feels important, and I appreciate your honesty. Sometimes it is helpful to talk about why we might have different experiences. Would you be open to trying that with me?""","""Nice work <span class=""bold"">exploring</span> how <span class=""bold"">differences in identity</span> may relate to Damian’s hesitancy to talk. This gently shows you are curious and willing to ""<span class=""bold"">explore the impact of identity on your therapeutic relationship</span>."""
3,bad1,"""It sounds like you are going through a lot of difficult things. If it feels more comfortable, could you tell me how more about your time here in college?""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">encourage</span> Damian to talk more about his college experience. This may <span class=""bold"">move the conversation away from the current cultural opportunity</span>. Try a different response that focuses on Damian’s hesitancy to discuss his concerns."""
3,bad2,"""No, I don’t imagine it’s you. My sense, and you can tell me otherwise, is that you’re worried about saying something controversial or offensive. Please don’t worry. I’ve heard it all.""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">reassure</span> Damian by referring to your expertise. While potentially helpful, Damian may be reluctant to speak up for other reasons.  Try a different response that focuses on Damian’s hesitancy to discuss his concerns."""
4,Damian,"""Thanks for saying that…It’s just…there are so many incidents. Like, people ask what sport I play on campus. <span class=""bold"">I don't even work out!</span> Or when I go into a store, and the employees follow me. And then that time, I got pulled over by a cop…""",
4,bad1,"""I’m feeling some confusion about this. Could you tell me more about what you mean? It sounds like there are a lot of pieces to this.""","""Here you are <span class=""bold"">self-disclosing</span> your sense of confusion related to the content Damian shared. Instead, how might you affirm Damian’s experiences of racism?"""
4,bad2,"""People who come to therapy often report seeing patterns that may or may not just be scary coincidences. How does that fit for you?""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">reflect</span> the potential fear that Damian is experiencing. While helpful,<span class=""bold"">consider Damian's expertise</span> and how he may already make sense of what is going on. Ask another question that may validate Damian’s perspective."""
4,good,"""You’ve experienced a lot of racism on and off-campus. I wonder if you want to talk more about how that relates to not “fitting in.""""","""Great choice. You’ve <span class=""bold"">affirmed</span> Damian’s experience by <span class=""bold"">naming oppressive systems</span> you noticed. This demonstrates you <span class=""bold"">believe in Damian and are comfortable discussing race in therapy</span>. This may help Damian feel safer talking about his experience."""
5,Damian,"""I can tell that when people see me, they only see my race. That I’m Black.""",
5,bad1,"""I want you to feel reassured when working with me. I see more than your color.""","""This choice uses <span class=""bold"">immediacy</span>. While the intent is to help Damian feel secure in therapy, <span class=""bold"">using colorblind microaaggressions</span> may further invalidate Damian’s experiences.

5,good,"""That sounds difficult. If you are comfortable sharing, what is it like for people to only see your race?""","""Good! This response further <span class=""bold"">explores </span> Damian’s Black identity collaboratively. This may help Damian feel safer, allowing him to share more with you authentically."""
5,bad2,"""Can you share a particular experience? I haven’t heard my clients describe that concern to me.""","""You’ve chosen to <span class=""bold"">explore</span> content.

6,good,"""That’s horrible. The way these systems continue to ignore violence against Black people is unjust.""","""This response <span class=""bold"">acknowledges</span> and <span class=""bold"">affirms</span> how <span class=""bold"">systems of power</span> harm Damian and the Black community at large.

7,Damian,"""Yeah, and it all just sucks. I know my grades are slipping. I want to stay in school. It’s just…how can I study when I got all these other things going on?""",

7,bad2,"""That sounds terrible…Hearing you talk makes me wonder if we can come up with some ideas for how to focus or strategize on your grades and coursework?""","""This response <span class=""bold"">reflects</span> and <span class=""bold"">focuses</span> on Damian’s desire to remain a student. This response may be solution-focused and it <span class=""bold"">may fail to address Damian's concerns with identity</span>."""
7,good,"""In light of all the bias you’ve experienced, it makes sense that it’d be hard to study. You feel unsafe and alone as a Black man on campus.""","""Nice response!

8,Damian,"""Exactly. Not just alone but stuck as well. Besides you… I haven’t really been able to talk about this with other people.""",

You are <span class=""bold"">exploring systems of power and privilege</span> that may make it harder for Damian to be open about the racial prejudice he has experienced."""
8,bad1,"""What you have told me sounds socially isolating. I wonder if getting out of your apartment more often could help with this?""","""Here you <span class=""bold"">direct</span> Damian towards a solution.

9,Damian,"""I think it just feels uncomfortable because this campus is very white. I can feel people tense up around me, which makes me tense up.""",

I have also wished that we lived in a world where we did not emphasize a person’s race as much.""","""This response attempts to <span class=""bold"">empathize</span> with Damian through <span class=""bold"">self-disclosure</span>.

9,good,"""That makes sense that being in predominantly white spaces brings out so much discomfort.
